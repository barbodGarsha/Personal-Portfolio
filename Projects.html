                            Frankfurter is an open-source API for current and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank. I used JS to Fetch the current exchange rates to make a Currency Converter. It also has a Virtual Keyboard and Dark Mode

                            idea of having an animated hero-design with CSS 
                            only.
                            <br><br>
                            If you hover over the Exploded Model in the hero section it will open up more and every piece moves at the right direction with the right angle. it was a real challenge to do this with CSS only.
                            <br><br>
                            I also had a single image of the model at the beginning. Therfore I had to extract every piece of the model and convert them into SVG files with online tools.
